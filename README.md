# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

AutosRUs' newest prototype, the MechaCar, is having production issues that is halting the manufacturing team's progress. The production data is available for review, and the goal of this analysis is to provide insights that could help the manufacturing team


## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
Fifty prototypes were produced using multiple design specs to identify ideal vehicle performance.
Multiple metrics, such as vehicle length, vehicle weight, spoiler angle, drivetrain, and ground clearance, were collected for each vehicle

### Figure 1 - Summary Statistics for Multiple Metrics on MPG

Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?


Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?

Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
